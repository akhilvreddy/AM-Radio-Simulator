# AM Radio Simulator
In this project, I aimed to design a amplitude modulator (AM) radio signal and modeled sending it into sky, somewhat like real radio stations do. I also tried to reason out why these are called _amplitude modulation_ waves, rather than _frequency modulation_. There's a lot of steps to get these signals from a .wav file to airwaves so I explained what I did here step by step. 


## .wav or mp3? 
For this project, I only used .wav files. This is because they are completely unaltered. Every single frequency within the file stays the same as it is, unlike mp3 files which end up filtering out the frequencies which human ears cannot pick up. Having a .wav file lets us keep the authentic file and makes it easier to edit and process.
